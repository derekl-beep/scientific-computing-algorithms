## Targets

To finish this repo, I will implement the numerical methods suggested in the reference, and also to make notes on different topics.
Apart from the references, I would also like to include some topics that I have hands-on expereience during my research studies. For example:

- Mathematical optimization
- Kalman filtering
- Structural dynamics
- Bayesian model updating
